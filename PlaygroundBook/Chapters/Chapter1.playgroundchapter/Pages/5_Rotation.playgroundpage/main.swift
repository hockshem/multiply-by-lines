 # Congratulations!
 You have finally reached the end of this playgroundbook! Before saying goodbye ü•∫, I would like to reveal to you the last secret of this multiplication method. ü§´
 
 That is...**YOU CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE FOUR DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WITH THE SINGLE FIGURE THAT YOU HAVE JUST DRAWN!** üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
 Let's examine the figure of the first question in this playgroundbook, `12 x 13`:
 
 ![Step 1](PageFiveStepOne.jpeg)
 
 üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Observe what happens when we rotate this figure by 90 degree!
 
 ![Step 2](PageFiveStepTwo.jpeg)
 
 The figure now gives us the answer to the question `13 x 21`! Without the need of drawing new sets of lines, we have automatically solved another math question. In fact, we can do this for two more times to get two more sets of solutions. ü§©
 
 Rotate it by 90 degree once more, we get the answer to `31 x 21`.

 Repeat this for one last time, we will notice that the figure now gives us the solution to `31 x 12`.
 
 ![Step 4](PageFiveStepFour.jpeg)
 
 We will get back to the original question that we have if we rotate the figure again.

 That marks the end of this playgroundbook!
 
 **Multiplication By Lines** are soooooo cool right! I really hope that you have enjoyed along this playground! ü•∞
