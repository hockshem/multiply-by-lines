 # Welcome to Math class!
 Hey, don't fall asleep yet! This is no ordinary Math class! I promise you will find some fun here! ðŸ˜œ
 
 I'm going to show you the **Japanese Multiplication Method**, where you can solve multiplication problems by just drawing.
 
 Yes, you read it correctly, you really just need to draw and count the lines that you have drawn.
 
 ## Let's get started!
 Say the math problem that you are given is `12 x 13`, you will need to draw sets of parallel lines representing each digit in the multiplicand and the multiplier, which is `12` and `13` respectively in this case.
 
 Let's start by representing the multiplicand in lines. For the `1` in `12`, you will need to draw **one** slanted line.

 Leave some space and for the `2` in `12`, draw **two** more lines parallel to line that you have just drawn.

 And you are done with the multiplicand. Now, time to draw the multiplier.
 
 For the `1` in `13`, draw **one** slanted line **perpendicular** to the lines representing the multiplicand.

 Again, leave some space and draw **three** more lines parallel to the line that you have just drawn. You will get a figure like this:

 ## Solution
 As you may have already noticed, the solution to the question has already been generated!
 
 Group the intesection points vertically. You will get three groups here.

 Count the total intersections in each group and jot down the number that you get.

 Read the numbers from left to right... Hurray! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ That's the answer! ðŸ¤©
 
 It's your turn now to try out this method!
 
 * Callout(Exercise):
 Use the Japanese Multiplication Method to solve the question given. You will have to:
    1. Draw the solution on the drawing area. For readability, you are suggested to use a ruler.
    2. Assign the answer that you get to `answer`.
 
 - Note: ðŸ—’
    * Tap and hold the drawing area to clear the drawings.
